## 📖 Overview

The research paper **"Sharp Monocular View Synthesis in Less Than a Second" (SHARP)** represents a breakthrough in photorealistic 3D synthesis. However, the original implementation is optimized for benchmarks, not production deployment.

**This repository does not contain the application code.**

Instead, it contains the **Engineering Blueprints** (PRD, Technical Specs) and **AI Context Prompts** required to build it. It is designed for engineers and founders who want to use AI coding tools (like Cursor, Windsurf, or GitHub Copilot) to generate a robust, scalable implementation without starting from scratch.

These specifications were generated by **ProdMoh**, an AI Architect that converts research papers into rigorous technical documentation.

## 📂 What's Inside?

We provide the foundational documents and context files needed to guide an AI agent in building this system:

### 1. 📋 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Defines *what* needs to be built.
- **User Stories:** Requirements for researchers vs. API consumers.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Latency budgets, scalability targets, and GPU constraints.
- **Success Metrics:** KPIs for system performance.

### 2. 🏗️ Technical Design Document (TDD)
Defines *how* it should be built.
- **Architecture:** Async inference pattern using Redis queues.
- **API Schema:** OpenAPI/Swagger definitions for input/output.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker containerization strategy and Nvidia Triton integration plans.

### 3. 🤖 AI Coding Prompts (.cursorrules)
The "Brain" for your AI Editor.
- **Context Rules:** Pre-engineered system prompts compatible with **Cursor** and **Windsurf**.
- **Tech Stack Constraints:** Instructions ensuring the AI uses specific versions of Python, FastAPI, and PyTorch.
- **Guardrails:** Rules to prevent the AI from hallucinating invalid library dependencies.

## Purpose

Most research papers describe what is *possible*. This repository provides the structural **context** needed to take SHARP from research to production.

By providing just the PRD, Specs, and Prompts, we enable you to:

- **Generate Code Faster:** Feed these specs into your AI editor to scaffold the project in minutes.
- **Customize the Build:** Modify the PRD before coding to fit your specific infrastructure needs.
- **Avoid "Spaghetti Code":** Ensure your AI agent follows a strict architectural pattern defined in the TDD.

## How to Use This Kit
Review the Blueprints: Read the PRD and TDD in the docs/ folder to understand the system goals.

Setup Your Environment: Open this repository in Cursor or Windsurf.

Activate the Prompts: Ensure the .cursorrules (or equivalent context file) is loaded by your editor.

Generate the Code: Open a chat with your AI and type:

"Using the PRD, Technical Spec, AI coding prompts provided in this repo, scaffold the FastAPI application structure."

## How to use:**
    1.  Download the `ai-context.json` file.
    2.  **For Cursor:** Copy the contents into your `.cursorrules` file at the root of your project.
    3.  **For Windsurf/Copilot:** Attach the file as "Context" in your chat window before asking it to generate code.
